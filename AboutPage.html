      <li>The Church of Craig is humbly dedicated to spreading our Illustrious Leader's Message of Love, Peace, and Unity.</li>
      <li>We are guided by the Leader's written works, the Code of Craig.</li>
      <li>The leader was once a lost soul like so many of us, but at his lowest point, he had a revelation!</li>
      <li>Divine words came to the creator from a higher power, and he spread the message to tge first of his followers.</li>
      <li>Since those first few, we have grown to a much larger family.</li>
      <li>Are you one of us?</li>
    </ul>
