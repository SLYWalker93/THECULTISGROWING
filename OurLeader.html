        <li>Our leader is an intensely private man.</li>
        <li>Pressure from those who do not understand his message have forced him to tread cautiously.</li>
        <li>Only the first disciples, and a select few of our flock have met him.</li>
        <li>It is said his smile warms the soul, and his laugh echoes like thunder!</li>
        <li>It is said when the end times comes, he will emerge from hiding and lead us to our destiny!</li>
        <li>For now we wait, and carry on his message and mission to unite the world!</li>
